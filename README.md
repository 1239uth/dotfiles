# My Dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles - configuration files for various tools and programs I use, such as `zsh`, `git`, etc.

I use a Mac with [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), configured with the [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme.

You can find my neovim configuration here: github.com/1239uth/nvim
